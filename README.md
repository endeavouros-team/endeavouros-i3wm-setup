## Display Setup

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/endeavouros-team/screenshots/master/arandr-display-setup-i3.png" alt="arandr-i3-display-setup" width="250"/>

* Open `arandr` and setup the display(s) as per your needs.
* Save the setup from `arandr` menu or button exactly with filename `monitor`.
* In i3 EndeavourOS we have a starter line in the `"${HOME}"/.config/i3/config`

  ```
  # start a script to setup displays
  # put `monitor.sh` into the location specified by this line
  exec --no-startup-id "${HOME}"/.screenlayout/monitor.sh
  ```

* This will handle to set display on each login.
* Alternatively, you could manually make a script with `xrandr`.

## Tiling

Tiling set to default for i3wm and can be changed to

* Stacking Mode - Only the focused window in the container is displayed. You get a list of windows at the top of the container.
* Tabbed Mode - Each new window will open in fullscreen as a tab, you can change between window tabs with mouse or shortcut

## Panel Bar (i3blocks)

* Uses `i3blocks`. Lets you view workspaces, active i3 blocks, tray icons and launch applications.
* Config - `"${HOME}"/.config/i3/i3blocks.conf`
* Pulse Audio

  * Use mouse wheel over volume level
  * Right click open pulseaudio control
* Weather
  * Get your API key - <https://openweathermap.org/appid>
  * Get your city code - <https://openweathermap.org/find?q=>
    * Search your city and take the city code from the URL bar in your browser (7 numbers at the end of the URL)
  * Add the API key and city code to `"$HOME"/.config/i3/scripts/openweather.sh`
* Tray Icons (network manager, update icon, etc.)

## Theming / Color Schemes

* Rofi Application Menu and Logout Menu

 `"${HOME}"/.config/rofi/rofidmenu.rasi`
 
 `"${HOME}"/.config/rofi/powermenu.rasi`

* Rofi Color Schemes

 `"${HOME}"/.config/rofi/arc_dark_transparent_colors.rasi`
 
 `"${HOME}"/.config/rofi/arc_dark_colors-ori.rasi`
 
Colors are in RGBA, calling transparency in the last column `rgba ( 26, 28, 35, 100 % )`

* GTK3 Theming and Icons

`"${HOME}"/.config/gtk-3.0`, `"${HOME}"/.Xresources`

There is ![nwg-look](https://github.com/nwg-piotr/nwg-look) installed where you can browse and set GTK theme, icons and xcursor theme.

 Xcursor needs `"${HOME}"/.Xresources`  on cases to have the right size in all cases.

 As some applications now went to GTK4 you can add a `"${HOME}"/.config/gtk-4.0/settings.ini` with only the theme lines:

```
[Settings]
gtk-theme-name=Arc-Dark
```

 With this gtk4 apps will also follow the theme (will be needed to change manually on theme changes)

 * Screen locker and locking session after sleep:
   blur-lock and xss-lock are used.
   see `~/.config/i3/config`
   
```
# lock by blurring the screen:
bindsym $mod+l exec --no-startup-id ~/.config/i3/scripts/blur-lock
# lock in case after sleep
exec --no-startup-id xss-lock --transfer-sleep-lock -- "~/.config/i3/scripts/blur-lock"
```

# Details/Options on the panel

You will find examples scripts and blocks under:

* scripts: `$HOME/.config/i3/scripts/`
* blocks: `$HOME/.config/i3/i3blocks.conf`

**open weather:**

run `~/.config/i3/scripts/openweather -s` to create setup you will need:
1. Fee API key from: https://openweathermap.org/api
2. city IDs from: https://openweathermap.org/find

Open i3blocks.conf and enable weather module by removing the commenting # there:

` nano $HOME/.config/i3/i3blocks.conf`

```
#[Weather]
#command=~/.config/i3/scripts/openweather
#interval=1800
#color=#7275b3
``` 


## Tutorial to install EndeavourOS-i3wm-setup from scratch

For installing it later on, in case if you have installed another DE on initial install from the ISO

1. Clone endeavouros-i3wm-setup dotfiles repo

    ```
    $ git clone https://github.com/endeavouros-team/endeavouros-i3wm-setup.git
    $ cd endeavouros-i3wm-setup/etc/skel/
    ```

2. Copy the files to user home directories.

    ```
    $ cp .Xresources "${HOME}"/.Xresources
    $ cp -R .config/* "${HOME}"/.config/
    ```

3. Make all scripts executable inside i3 config

    ```
    $ chmod -R +x "${HOME}"/.config/i3/scripts
    ```

4. Apply settings and theming for `xed` text editor

    ```
    $ dbus-launch dconf load / < xed.dconf
    ```

5. Install using different methods

    * **Method 1** - Using EndeavourOS-packages-lists repo

        ```
        $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/endeavouros-team/EndeavourOS-packages-lists/master/i3
        $ sudo pacman -S --needed - < i3
        ```

    * **Method 2** - Using eos-packagelist package from EOS repo

        ```
        $ eos-packagelist --install "i3-Window-Manager"
        ```

    * **Method 3** - Using the i3_install script from the git for automated config and package installation in user home directory.
    **WARNING - Method 3 will overwrite existing files. Make sure you backup users configs before running it on your own.**

        ```
        $ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/endeavouros-team/endeavouros-i3wm-setup/main/i3_install
        $ ./i3_install
        ```
