# endeavouros-i3wm-setup
**maintainer: joekamprad --->  setup for i3-wm under [EndeavourOS](https://endeavouros.com) new config 2022 <---**

[![Maintenance](https://img.shields.io/maintenance/yes/2023.svg)]() [![](https://img.shields.io/github/contributors/endeavouros-team/endeavouros-i3wm-setup.svg?style=flat)](https://github.com/endeavouros-team/endeavouros-i3wm-setup/graphs/contributors)

# Tutorial for i3-wm settings:
* background handled by [feh](https://feh.finalrewind.org/)
* gtk3 theme handled by [lxappearance-gtk3](https://wiki.lxde.org/de/LXAppearance)
* Filebrowser = [Thunar](https://docs.xfce.org/xfce/thunar/start)
* default Terminal-Emulator = [xfce4-terminal](https://docs.xfce.org/apps/terminal/start)
  * This is set also inside ~/.profile (export TERMINAL=xfce4-terminal) so remind to change it there too if you want to change4 default terminal.
* Text-Editor = [xed](https://github.com/linuxmint/xed)
* [dex](https://github.com/jceb/dex) : autostarting apps from /etc/xdg/autostart/ (*)
* Notifications are done with [dunst](https://dunst-project.org): CONFIG FILE = ~/.config/dunst/dunstrc

**dex is enabled by default in config to autostart like on a DE. To disable, comment out the line:** 

`exec --no-startup-id dex --autostart --environment i3`

inside `~/.config/i3/config`.

# Main shortcuts:
[mod] key is set to the win-key (or should i call it linkey?)

# Display setup with arandr
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/endeavouros-team/screenshots/master/arandr-display-setup-i3.png "arandr-i3-display-setup")
* open arandr and setup display/s as you need.
* save the setup from arandr menu or button exactly with filename `monitor`.
---> on i3 EndeavourOS we have a starter line in the ~/.config/i3/config

```
# start a script to setup displays
# put `monitor.sh` into the location specified by this line:
exec --no-startup-id ~/.screenlayout/monitor.sh
```
this will handle to set display on each login.
alternatively, you could manually make a script with xrandr.

# Tiling:
is set to default for i3wm and can be changed to: 
* stacking:
Only the focused window in the container is displayed. You get a list of windows at the top of the container.

* tabbed:
so each new window will open fullscreen as a tab, you can change between window-tabs with mouse or shortcut:
[mod]+**Left** focus left (left arrow key)
[mod]+**Right** focus right (right arrow key)

# i3blocks:
* pulseaudio (mousewheel volume level, rightclick open pulseaudio control)
* weather (openweather you need to get city code and apikey first [adding it to ~/.config/i3/scripts/openweather.sh])
get your api key here: https://openweathermap.org/appid and City code: https://openweathermap.org/find?q= (search your city     and take the city code from the url in your browser [7 numbers at the end of the url])
* tray-icons (showing network-manager and update-icon)
* logout button (poweroff, logout, suspending, hibernate e.t.c.)

# panel bar (i3-blocks):
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/endeavouros-team/screenshots/master/panel.png "bar legende")
* CONFIG FILE = ~/.config/i3/i3blocks.conf
# Logout Menu (rofi):
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/endeavouros-team/screenshots/master/i3-power-nov21.png "logout-menu")
* CONFIG FILE = ~/.config/i3/scripts/powermenu
# application menu (rofi):
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/endeavouros-team/screenshots/master/eos-i3-shot-nov21.png "appmenu")
* rofi color-schemes: ~/.config/rofi/arc_dark_transparent_colors.rasi
# power-profiles handler menu:
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/endeavouros-team/screenshots/master/ppd-i3.png "power-profiles")
* let you easely switch powermodes from the i3-bar.

## theming/colorshemes:   

**for rofi menus (application menu and Logout menu):**

They can be adjust and chenged inside ~/.config/rofi directory:

**Configurations for the menus:**

* `~/.config/rofi/rofidmenu.rasi`
* `~/.config/rofi/powermenu.rasi`

**colorschemes:**

* `~/.config/rofi/arc_dark_transparent_colors.rasi`
* `~/.config/rofi/arc_dark_colors-ori.rasi`

colors are in rgba calling transparency in the last colum:

`rgba ( 26, 28, 35, 100 % )`

**General theming // gtk3 and icons:**   
* `~/.config/gtk-3.0`
* `~/.Xresources`   
There is ![LXAppearance](https://wiki.lxde.org/en/LXAppearance) installed where you can browse and set GTK3 theme, icons and Xcursortheme.   
But Xcursor  needs to be set inside the `~/.Xresources`  manually if you change it in LXAppearance to get applied for all apps.

# Tutorial to install EndeavourOS-i3 setup from scratch 
**for later installs, if you have installed another DE on initial install from the ISO**

1. get the dot files:

`git clone https://github.com/endeavouros-team/endeavouros-i3wm-setup.git`

`cd endeavouros-i3wm-setup`

2. copy files to the right directories (.config of your user):

`cp .Xresources ~/.Xresources`

`cp -R .config/* ~/.config/`

3. Scripts inside `~/.config/i3/scripts` must be executable:

`chmod -R +x ~/.config/i3/scripts` 

4. set theming for xed texteditor:

`dbus-launch dconf load / < xed.dconf`

5. install needed packages:

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/endeavouros-team/EndeavourOS-packages-lists/master/i3`

`sudo pacman -S --needed - < i3`

or use the packages tool from our repo: `eos-packagelist --install "i3-Window-Manager"`

**Use the `i3_install` script from the git for automatic install it to your users home:**
This script will setup configurations needed and install all needed packages:

`wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/endeavouros-team/endeavouros-i3wm-setup/main/i3_install`
and run it: `./i3_install`

**warning i3_install will overwrite existing files**
Make sure you backup users configs before running it on your own.
